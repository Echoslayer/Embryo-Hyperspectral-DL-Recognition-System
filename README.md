## Updated log 

- [ ] Grad-CAM & weights gradien analysis

7/2 Retract message: maxpooling can calculate gradients, fix grad-cam bugs, and try two experiments(maxpooling and average pool), add experiment notes(Obsidian).

7/1 New found: Grad-CAM can't use maxpooling, gradients need to switch to AveragePooling2D.

6/28 new train(60 epochs) is overfits, fix attension map, starting Grad-CAM & weights gradien analysis

6/25 save model and save test, normalization bug fixxing -> grad-cam application is not actuallly right -> need fix

6/24 Change directory function from string type to pathlib.Path

4/22 Confusion matrix Bug fix

3/21 Visualize CNN layer output and try new data

3/20 visaulize cnn filter

3/11 data augmentation train, senier sister model fix(add polling layer)
